"NodeQuest" is a video game with the following features:

- **Premise.** You control a samurai, unable to attack but has jumping skills, who must navigate through a poop filled platformer! The horror!

- **Design Idea.** The team and I just wanted to talk about our lives while making something at the same time.

- **Future endeavors.** Much longer level with a working HUD and exciting controls.
